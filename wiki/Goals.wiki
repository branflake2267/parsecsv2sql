= Goals =
 If you just happen on this project and wondering what I am up to here this should help. I just hate doing things over and over again with data, so I decided to build these classes to import, export, transfer, parse and correlate disparate sets of data.

= Whats Built =

= Helper Classes =
 * query helper classes
 * transform helper classes

= Import =
 Semi-autonomous import, imports csv data sizes columns. Import by rules.
 * TODO finish the auto type recognition in flat file and sql

= Export =
 Export back to csv or sql

= Transfer =
 * Transfer records from one table to another
 * Transfer records from one table to multiple tables
 * TODO revise how the public fields are mapped.

= DateTime parser =
 * english datetime parser, recognize many different ways a date can be said

= Address Parser =
 * simple address parser
 * TODO more complex with outside address comapring

= Correlate =
 Current project - correlate by rules
